This is Nav Blog, or the greatest blog of all time, here I share my experiences with programming, new things I came up with and some coding projects to challenge yourselves, you can send me mails sharing your experiences as well.

This is Basically it for the introduction of this blog, I will start adding blog posts as soon as possible and code regularly on my YouTube Channel.

If you want to learn to code I have provided a few links down below, but, I will make a separate blog post as well, these are just raw sources.

1. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) - This is the starting point, he has very good tutorials on web development.
2. [Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg) - For C++ Competitve Programming.
3. [William Lin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKuDLsO0Wwef53qdHPjbU2Q) - C++ Competitive Programming.

5. [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/) - To Practise Competitive Programming.

The plans for the rest of my Year 9 are: I will code every weekend live on my YouTube channel and start adding my voice when I am at 20 Subscribers, During my break I would code live everyday on my youtube channel, the plan is to complete the game I have started work on, though this is a weekend project and the rest of the days I would do some competitive programming.

I would participate in the Australian Informatics Olympiad this year, lots of preparations to do. Support would be appreciated.

I have provided my e-mail address in the YouTube about section for you to write mails and suggest me some ideas or fixes in some projects, Asking some basic questions, helps in coding, etc.

More Information about me: I have been coding since I was 8 and started to code a mobile app, it was a self-made programming language and got my first computer when I was 10, I started off with HTML, CSS and started JavaScript within a month after learning HTML and CSS, Then I learnt, Java, then I learnt C, and then I learnt C++, then at the end I learnt Python3, this is a weird way of learning how to code, I recommend started with HTML, CSS and Javascript, then Python3, then Java and then C and then C++, The end part gets you fimiliar with computer science, I highly recommend learning C and then C++.
